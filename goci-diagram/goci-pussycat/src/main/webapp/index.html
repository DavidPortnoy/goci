                    <h3>Background</h3>

                    <p>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association
                        Studies or GWAS catalogue provides a quality controlled, manually curated, literature-derived
                        collection of all published GWA studies assaying at least 100'000 SNPs and all SNP-trait
                        associations with p-values < 1.0 &lowast; 10<sup>-5</sup> <i>(Hindorff et al., 2009)</i>.
                        Publicly available at <a href="http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies">http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies</a>,
                        the catalogue can be searched by a number of options including journal, first author, trait,
                        chromosomal region, gene, SNP, odds ratio and p-value threshold. As of 06/04/12, it includes
                        1233 publications and 6186 SNPs. In addition to the SNP-trait association data, the catalogue
                        also publishes the iconic GWAS diagram of all SNP-trait associations mapped to the SNPs&rsquo;
                        chromosomal locations. The diagram is released quarterly and the latest version of the diagram
                        is made available on the GWAS catalogue website in PDF format and as a PowerPoint slide.</p>

                    <p>This page hosts a beta version of a novel system that generates the GWAS diagram dynamically
                        using an ontology and scalable vector graphics (SVG). Ultimately, the diagram produced on this
                        fashion can be filtered and searched at different levels of granularity and by different
                        criteria, including trait, chromosomal region and time. It is going to be possible to zoom in
                        over chromosomes in order to see all SNP-trait associations for a given region. SNP-trait
                        associations are also
                        going to be interactive, providing summary information on mouse-over as well as being clickable
                        to allow proceeding from an association to the catalogue entry and to the publication.</p>

                    <h3>Status update</h3>

                    <p>
                        This is a list of features currently (or soon to be) available in the diagram:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Colours:</b> A new colour scheme for the diagram is under development in collaboration
                            with the
                            NHGRI GWAS catalog curation team.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Number of studies:</b> In order to minimise ontology reasoning times, the beta version of
                            the diagram only displays a dozen studies.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Mouse-over:</b> Hovering over a chromosome or coloured circle displays the name of the
                            corresponding
                            chromosome or trait. This feature is not supported by all web browsers - it is known to work
                            in Mozilla
                            Firefox but not Google Chrome.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Filtering options:</b> Filtering capabilities will be rolled out for testing as soon as
                            they are implemented. Basic filtering options should be available in the next few weeks.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> This section aims to provide some guidance on how the use the new dynamic GWAS diagram. For an
                        introduction
                        to the GWAS catalog, see the "Home" tab.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Initial diagram generation:</b> When the "Diagram" tab is first selected, there may be a
                            delay of up to
                            30s before the diagram is rendered. This is because all the information in the diagram is
                            rendered dynamically,
                            and this requires a certain amount of processing. Please be patient and do not try to reload
                            as this will simply
                            cause the rendering process to restart.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Number of studies:</b> The beta version of the GWAS diagram shows only a dozen studies in
                            order to reduce
                            processing overheads during the testing phase. More studies will be added soon.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Zooming:</b> It is possible to zoom the diagram in and out by using the scroll wheel on
                            the mouse. Scrolling
                            up zooms in and scrolling down zooms out.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Moving the diagram:</b> When zooming in, part of the diagram appears off the right side
                            of the screen. This is
                            because the area of the screen in which diagram can be viewed remains the same size, even as
                            the size of the underlying
                            diagram changes. The diagram can be moved around the viewing area by clicking on any part of
                            the diagram with the left
                            mouse button and, holding the mouse button down, dragging the diagram around the screen
                            until the desired part is visible.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Labels:</b> Chromosomes and traits (coloured circles) have labels that display when
                            hovering the mouse pointer over
                            a given feature. Note that this functionality is only available in some web browsers, such a
                            Mozilla Firefox. It does not work
                            in Google Chrome.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Number of traits:</b> Some chromosomal regions have large numbers of traits associated
                            with them. In order to keep the
                            diagram readable, no more than six traits will be displayed for any region for the full
                            diagram. If there are more traits available
                            for a given region, this is indicated by the presence of an ellipsis (...) at the end of a
                            line of traits. At present, this ellipsis
                            is static, i.e. it is not possible to access the undisplayed traits through it. We are
                            currently working on a feature that
                            generates a zoomed-in version of the corresponding region if an ellipsis is clicked on.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Colours:</b> A new colour scheme for the GWAS diagram is currently under development. A
                            legend will soon be added to the
                            diagram page, detailing which colour represents which trait or category of traits. At
                            present, blue represents traits for which
                            not colour category is available yet.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Filtering:</b> Various filtering capabilities are currently under development. They will
                            include filtering the diagram by
                            one or more GWAS traits or trait categories, filtering by study, chromosomal region and
                            p-value. New features will be made
                            available for testing as soon as they are implemented so check back regularly for updates.
                        </li>
