| GOCI Pussycat - Profile Notes |
+-------------------------------+

There are several maven build profiles that can be used to generate the GOCI Pussycat web application.  These profiles
and their various default setups are documented below.

 1. Production
 =============

 Intended for running in production environments.  This setup suits London Datacentre deployment.
 Is built after each release.

 Configuration files located in:
  /src
    /main
      /resources-production
      /webresources-production

  Logs to ${catalina.base}/logs/${tomcat.hostname}/goci.log at an info level

  Uses last stable release of EFO from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/efo.owl

  Will never classify and reason over the knowledgebase, only EFO.  SVG files must have been generated in another
  instance and the cached files deployed with the web application

  SVG cache (only accessible from staging, olivers yard or power gate machines) located in:
   /nfs/public/rw/fg/fgpt/goci-home/diagram/cache/

 2. Test
 =======

  Intended for running in test (wwwdev) environments.  This setup suits test staging area deployment (ves-hx-73).
  Is built weekly, on Friday nights.

  Configuration files located in:
   /src
     /main
       /resources-test
       /webresources-test

   Logs to ${catalina.base}/logs/${tomcat.hostname}/goci.log at an info level

   Uses last stable release of EFO from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/efo.owl

   Classifies and reasons over the knowledgebase, but utilises cache if present.  Manually delete SVG files to force
   rerendering.

   Knowledgebase file used to perform rendering:
    /src
      /main
        /webapp
          /ontology
            /gwas-diagram-data-2012-08.owl

   SVG cache (only accessible from staging machine) located in:
    /nfs/public/rw/fg/fgpt/goci-home/diagram/cache/


 3. Devtest
 ==========

   Intended for running in developer test (orange) environment.
   Is built after every committed change to the codebase.

   Configuration files located in:
    /src
      /main
        /resources-test
        /webresources-test

    Logs to ${catalina.base}/logs/goci.log at a debug level

    Uses release candidate of EFO from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/efo.owl

    Classifies and reasons over the knowledgebase everytime.  Does not use a cache.

    Knowledgebase file used to perform rendering:
     /src
       /main
         /webapp
           /ontology
             /gwas-diagram-data-2007-12.owl


 4. Localtest
 ============

   Intended as a template testing setup for developers to run on their local machine.  Change this as appropriate.
   Can be built at will! (Ideally before committing any changes...)

   Configuration files located in:
    /src
      /main
        /resources-localtest
        /webresources-localtest

   Logs to ${catalina.base}/logs/${tomcat.hostname}/goci.log at debug/trace level

   Uses release candidate of EFO from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/efo.owl

   Classifies and reasons over the knowledgebase, but utilises cache if present.  Manually delete SVG files to force
   rerendering.

   Knowledgebase file used to perform rendering:
    /src
      /main
        /webapp
          /ontology
            /gwas-diagram-data-local.owl

   SVG cache (only accessible from staging machine) located in:
    /{user.home}/.goci/svg_cache/
